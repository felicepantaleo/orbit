### File type recognition
Images, PDFs, videos, audio, text/code, CSV, notebooks, archives, documents, and scientific formats such as `ROOT`, `HDF5`, `FITS`, `Parquet`, `NumPy`, and `HepMC`.

## Setup

### Requirements
- A web server with **PHP ≥ 8.0**
- A folder you want to browse
- No database, build step, or npm tooling

### Installation

1. Copy `index.php` into the root of the folder you want to expose.
2. Open the page in your browser.
3. Browse files and folders immediately.

Orbit serves both the frontend and the backend API from the same `index.php` file.

## How it works

```text
Browser  ──GET /?action=list&path=/subdir──►  index.php  ──scandir()──►  filesystem
         ◄──── JSON: [{name, size, type, …}] ────────────────────────────────────────

Browser  ──GET /?action=meta&path=/img.jpg──►  index.php  ──metadata / EXIF──►
         ◄──── JSON: {exif: {camera, settings, gps}, image: {width, height}} ───────

Browser  ──GET /?action=file&path=/img.jpg──►  index.php  ──stream file bytes──►
         ◄──── inline file response / download ──────────────────────────────────────
```

The `action=file` endpoint ensures previews and downloads work reliably even when direct static file access is not available or not configured the way the browser expects.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Focus search box |
| `Esc` | Close preview / metadata panel |
| `←` / `→` | Navigate between files in preview |
| Right-click | Open metadata panel for a file |

---

## Security

- **Path traversal prevention**: all paths are resolved with `realpath()` and verified to stay inside `BASE_DIR`
- **Script self-exclusion**: `index.php` hides itself from the file listing
- **Hidden files hidden**: dotfiles (`.htaccess`, `.git`, …) are not shown
- **Security headers**: `X-Content-Type-Options` and `X-Frame-Options` are sent by the PHP app

---

## Customisation

Edit the `CONFIG` object in `index.php` to change defaults such as the initial view, previewable text extensions, and lazy-loading threshold.

To rename the app again, update the `<title>`, header logo text, and subtitle in `index.php`.
